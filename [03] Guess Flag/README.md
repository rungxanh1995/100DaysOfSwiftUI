#  Guess Flag üèÅ

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
A quiz game asking players to guess the country's flag.

This project is a tutorial project from [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).

## Functionality Extensions üë®‚Äçüíª
I developed extra features beyond the scope of its original tutorial via due research and critical problem-solving skills.
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Feature</th>
			<th>Details</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Animations</td>
			<td>
			Animate the UI after player has selected a flag as their answer
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Grand Central Dispatch</td>
			<td>
			Auto advance to next question using DispatchQueue asyncAfter API
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>User Score</td>

			</td>
		</tr>

	</tbody>
</table>

## Concept Extensions üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I also proactively implemented extra concepts on top of the extra features, including:
<table>

		</tr>
		<tr>
